        <p>Full stack developers are perhaps some of the most highly regarded professionals within the field of web development,<br />
          but what is a full stack developer? Broadly speaking, they are web developers equipped to work with a digital entity’s front and back ends, <br />
          meaning they are usually skilled with aspects of computer programming, user experience (UX) design, project management,
          <<br />
          and in many cases, client communication. This specialized hybridization has generally increased the demand for full stack developers in a variety of professional capacities.
